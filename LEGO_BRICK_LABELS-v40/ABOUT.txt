ABOUT LEGO BRICK LABELS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This collection of well over 1000 LEGO Brick Labels was created by Tom Alphin,
author of the bestselling book, The LEGO Architect.  The labels were designed for
storage solutions with a lot of separate compartments, such as a cabinet of small drawers.
The labels are designed to be printed on a Brother Label printer.

For more information and help buying the Brother Label Printer, and tips for great
storage solutions, please visit:

For the ultimate guide to organizing, sorting, and storage for your LEGO colleciton,
you should also read my LEGO Storage Guide, which you can find at:

Sincerely,
-Tom Alphin
